```

## Requirements
It needs another my project [alphabetPy](https://github.com/RayZhao1998/alphabetPy),it'll be installed when you install `ClockPaper`

## Usage
You just need to use the command `ClockPaper`, and you'll see a digital clock and date.

However, I haven't known how to change the location according to the size of terminal, so I just use `\n`and space to make it in middle.

If your computer is 13 inch, you can make your terminal full screen to have a better user experience.
